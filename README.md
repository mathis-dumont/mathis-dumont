# Mathis Dumont

Welcome ! I'm an AI Engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering (Arts & Métiers) and Data Science (ENSAE Paris). I build end-to-end intelligent systems, from predictive ML models to generative AI architectures.

### About Me

Coming from Arts & Métiers and ENSAE Paris, I look at AI through two lenses: mathematical rigor and industrial reality. I make sure the models work in production environments and bring value. My work ranges from classic ML for predictive maintenance to advanced generative architectures and agentic workflows

### Technical Expertise

*   **Machine Learning & DL:** Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM), Anomaly Detection (Autoencoders), Time Series, and Cost-Sensitive Learning.
*   **Generative AI:** Multi-agent systems (ReAct), LLM fine-tuning (LoRA), Multimodal RAG, and Prompt Engineering.
*   **Engineering & Ops:** Full-stack ML pipelines, FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, and ETL orchestration.
*   **Leadership:** Former Head of Sales at Arts & Métiers Junior Enterprise (Managed €250k turnover).

### Featured Projects

*   **[Horse Racing Prediction](https://github.com/mathis-dumont/horse-racing-prediction):** (Core ML) Production-grade XGBoost pipeline with automated daily ETL and market analysis.
*   **[Multi-Agent Documentation](https://github.com/mathis-dumont/documentation_generator):** (GenAI) Automated codebase analysis using Mistral-powered reasoning agents.
*   **[Fraud Detection Research](https://mathis-dumont.github.io/documents/fraud-detection-report.pdf):** Comparison of Supervised vs. Unsupervised (Autoencoders) methods for highly imbalanced data.
