# Mathis Dumont

I am an AI Engineer with a dual background in Mechanical Engineering (Arts & Métiers) and Data Science (ENSAE Paris). I focus on building end-to-end systems, moving from predictive ML models to agentic AI workflows.

### About Me

I approach AI with a focus on production reliability. My goal is to build models that function outside of notebooks and solve actual industrial problems. My work ranges from classic ML for predictive maintenance to designing autonomous agent architectures.

Previously, I managed client projects as Head of Sales at a Junior Enterprise. This taught me how to align engineering constraints with business requirements.

### Technical Stack

*   **Machine Learning:** Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM), Anomaly Detection (Autoencoders), Time Series, Cost-Sensitive Learning.
*   **GenAI & LLMs:** Multi-agent systems (ReAct), Fine-tuning (LoRA), Multimodal RAG, Prompt Engineering.
*   **Engineering & Ops:** Full-stack ML pipelines, FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, ETL orchestration.

### Featured Projects

*   **[Multi-Agent Documentation](https://github.com/mathis-dumont/documentation_generator):** (GenAI) An automated system that uses Mistral-powered agents and the ReAct framework to reverse-engineer and document codebases.
*   **[Horse Racing Prediction](https://github.com/mathis-dumont/horse-racing-prediction):** (Core ML) A production-grade XGBoost pipeline with automated daily ETL, market analysis, and a betting strategy algorithm.
*   **[Fraud Detection Research](https://mathis-dumont.github.io/documents/fraud-detection-report.pdf):** (Research) A technical comparison of Supervised vs. Unsupervised (Autoencoders) methods for detecting fraud in highly imbalanced datasets.
