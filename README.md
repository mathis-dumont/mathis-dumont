### Background

I am currently pursuing a Master in Data Science at **ENSAE Paris**, following a Master of Engineering at **Arts & Métiers**. My experience ranges from developing defect prediction models for **ArcelorMittal** to leading sales strategies for a Junior Enterprise.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of theoretical foundations and practical software engineering, specifically in:
*   **LLM Agents & Reasoning**
*   **MLOps & Production Engineering**
