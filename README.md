### About Me

After my engineering degree in Arts et Métiers ParisTech, I'm pursuing a Master of Data Science at ENSAE Paris. My focus is on building AI systems that can be deployed in real-world settings, working with agentic frameworks, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architectures, and theoretical advances translated into production-ready solutions.

### Technical Highlights

*   **AI & Research:** Multi-agent systems (ReAct), LLM fine-tuning (LoRA/PEFT), Multimodal RAG, and Autoencoders.
*   **Engineering & Ops:** Full-stack ML pipelines (FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions), Industrial modeling at ArcelorMittal, and ETL orchestration.
*   **Leadership:** Former Head of Sales at Arts & Métiers Junior Enterprise (Best JE in France 2024, managed €250k turnover).

### Featured Projects

*   **Multi-Agent Documentation:** Advanced system leveraging Mistral reasoning for automated code analysis.
*   **LLM Benchmarking:** Comparative study on fine-tuning vs prompting for hallucination reduction.
*   **Horse Racing Platform:** Production-grade ML platform with microservices architecture and automated ETL.
